My web site is my portfolio. I have login page where I can enter my web site. But I donâ€™t have registration. Even though I have one user in my users table who is me. I have 3 tables in my project which are Users, Forms, Files. ERD of them you can see below. Inside Users table I store all users with their passwords. And inside Forms and Files I store general information about user that filled form and file that he attached in form. These two tables related by ine to one relation using foreign key form_id.
